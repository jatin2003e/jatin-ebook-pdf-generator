## Features

See application screens and API endpoints in `app.py`. This is a working, self-hostable MVP intended as a strong foundation for a commercial product. Production deployment requires domain/TLS, external backups, monitoring, and a security review.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Set strong SECRET_KEY and ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:5000. For Docker: `docker compose up --build`.

## Testing

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Security and operations

- Never commit `.env`, customer files, private keys, or databases.
- Set unique secrets and serve behind HTTPS in production.
- Change default secrets before exposure to the internet.
- Implement rate limiting, backups, audit logs, and external transactional email as appropriate.
- Only distribute content you own or have rights to sell.
